# 🚀 Rocket CLI

Rocket CLI will by my syntactic sugar on top of the [Strapi](https://strapi.io) CLI, specifically with creating projects and organizing them. The rest will be mananged by the Strapi CLI itself.

## Specifications/Goals 🎯

Trying to decide between NPM package or Bash script right now.

- Start a project with a default folder name (date-number_of_project)
- Specify name prefix with flag (`--normal` or `--issue`)
- Search for projects by specifying some date ranges i.e: `rocket yesterday` to navigate to yesterdays folder or `rocket --list yesterday` to list yesterdays folder
- Specify version number for strapi
- Specify array of strapi flags (some may be default)

## Future goals

- Maybe have a registry to store projects generated with rocket and store descriptions for easier search? That would be nice.
